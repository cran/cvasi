#' Algae model with exponential growth and forcings (I, T)
#'
#'The model is a mechanistic combined toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK/TD) and
#'growth model for algae. The model simulates the development of algal biomass
#'under laboratory and environmental conditions and was developed by
#'Weber et al. (2012) as cited in EFSA TKTD opinion (2018). The growth of the
#'algae population is simulated on the basis of growth rates, which are
#'dependent on environmental conditions (radiation, temperature and phosphorus).
#'The toxicodynamic sub-model describes the effects of growth-inhibiting
#'substances through a corresponding reduction in the photosynthesis rate on
#'the basis of internal concentrations. (the implementation of Weber et al.
#'(2012) is followed where units differ with EFSA)
#'
#' @section State variables:
#' The model has four state variables:
#' - `A`, Biomass (ug fresh wt/mL, cells/mL *10^4)
#' - `Q`, Mass of phosphorous internal (mg P/L, or ug P/mL)
#' - `P`, Mass of phosphorous external (mg P/L, or ug P/mL)
#' - `C`, external substance concentration (ug/L)
#'
#' @section Model parameters:

#' properties as time-series input: Irradiance (`I`, uE/m²/s)
#' and temperature (`T_act`, deg C).
#' Forcings time-series are represented by `data.frame` objects
#' consisting of two columns. The first for time and the second for the
#' environmental factor in question. The input format for all forcings is a
#' list of the data frames.

#' @section Simulation output:
#' Simulation results will contain the state variables Biomass (`A`), mass of
#' internal phosphorous (`Q`), mass of external phosphorous (`P`) and the external
#' concentration (`C`). The derivatives are also available as additional output.

#' Algae model with exponential growth but without additional forcings
#'
#' The model is a mechanistic combined toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK/TD) and
#' growth model for algae. It follows the concept of a simplified algae model
#' described in Rendal et al. (2023). The model simulates the development of
#' algal biomass. The growth of the algae population is simulated on the basis
#' of growth rates, which are, in contrast to the Weber model, independent on
#' environmental conditions which are usually optimal in laboratory effect studies.
#' The toxicodynamic sub-model describes the effects of growth-inhibiting
#' substances through a corresponding reduction in the photosynthesis rate on the
#' basis of either external or internal concentrations (depending on user choice of 'scaled' parameter setting).
#'
#' @section State variables:
#' The model has two state variables:
#' - `A`, Biomass (ug fresh wt/mL, cells/mL *10^4)
#' - `Dw`, only used if scaled = 1
#'
#' @section Model parameters:
#' - Growth model
#'   - `mu_max`, Maximum growth rate (d-1)
#'
#' - Concentration response (Toxicodynamics)
#'   - `EC_50`, Effect concentration of 50% inhibition of growth rate (ug L-1)
#'   - `b`, slope of concentration effect curve at EC_50 (-)
#'   - `dose_response`, shape of the dose response curve (0 = logit, 1 = probit)
#'
#' - External concentration (Toxicokinetics)
#'   - `kD`, dominant rate constant of toxicant in aquatic environments (d-1)
#'   - `scaled`, 0 = no internal scaled damage / 1 = yes (-)
#'
#' @section Forcings:
#' Simplified model without additional forcings for e.g. irradiation or temperature
#' as implemented in `Algae_Weber`. A constant growth over time is assumed.
#' In case that growth is time dependent, a forcing variable (f_growth) can be set.
#' Forcing time-series are represented by `data.frame` objects consisting of two
#' columns. The first for time and the second for a scaling factor of mu_max.
#' The input format for all forcings is a list of the data frames. If f_growth is
#' not set, a default scaling factor of 1 is used.
#'
#' @section Parameter boundaries:
#' Upper and lower parameter boundaries are set by default for each parameter. This,
#' to avoid extreme values during calibration (particularly likelihood profiling)
#'
#' @section Simulation output:
#' Simulation results will contain the state variables biomass (`A`) and in case
#' of scaled damage the damage concentration (`Dw`). The derivatives are also
#' available as additional output.
