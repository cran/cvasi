#' Set transfer events
#'
#' A *transfer* refers to an event where a certain amount of biomass (*BM*)
#' is moved to a new medium after a period of time. This feature replicates
#' a procedure occurring e.g. in Lemna effect studies and may be necessary to recreate
#' study results.
#'
#' Any transfer time point must also be an output time point. If a transfer
#' occurs, simulation results of that time point will report the model state
#' **before** the transfer. Be aware that in order to use transfers at regular
#' intervals, the simulation must start at time point zero.
#'
#' ### Transferred biomass
#'
#' At each transfer, a defined amount of biomass is transferred to a new medium.
#' This is modeled by interrupting the simulation at a transfer time point, modifying
#' the biomass level `BM`, and scaling affected compartments according to new
#' biomass levels. Scaling of compartments depending on biomass, such as
#' *internal toxicant mass*, is necessary to correctly reflect mass balances and
#' concentrations over time.
#'
#' Transferred biomass is set using the `biomass` parameter. Is is either a
#' single numerical value in which case the same biomass level is set at each
#' transfer. Or it is a vector of numerical values with the same length as the
#' `times` parameter in which case a custom biomass level can be set for each
#' transfer. Multiple biomass levels can only be set in conjunction with
#' custom transfer time points.
#'
#' Some scenario types define default values for transferred biomass based
#' on common study set ups.
#'
#' ### Regular and custom transfer time points
#'
#' Transfers can occur either in regular intervals of time or at selected, custom
#' time points. For regular intervals, the parameter `interval` is set to a single
#' numeric value which has the same unit as the scenario's time dimension. As an
#' example: if a scenario uses the unit of *days* for time, the transfer interval
#' is also specified in *days*:
#'
#' Transfers occurring at custom time points are set by passing a numerical vector
#' to the parameter `times`. The time points' units must match with the unit of
#' time in the scenario. A custom transfer time point **must not occur at the
#' starting time point of a simulation**.
#'
#' ### Affected compartments
#'
#' Some compartments depend on biomass to correctly reflect mass balances and
#' concentrations over time, such as *internal toxicant mass*. These compartments
#' need to be scaled linearly to reflect the change in biomass levels.
#' The parameter `scaled_comp` accepts a character vector of compartment names
#' which are scaled at each transfer. This parameter should only be used with
#' custom, user-defined models. If no compartment needs to be scaled, set or
#' use the default value of `character(0)`.
