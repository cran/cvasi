\description{
A sample of parameters representing the uncertainty within the dataset
is passed to the function. All parameter combinations and exposure patterns
are simulated and the range of predicted frond numbers is derived for a
single study. The uncertainty is displayed by a Posterior Predictive Plot
(PPC). The data (rs_mean, obs_mean and obs_full) must have the
following format (col1 = time, col2 = data of interest, col3 = trial name).
Data for uncertainties (rs_range) must have the format: col1 = time,
col2 = lower boundaries, col3 = upper boundaries, col4 = trial. The user
should take care of the input data and consider whether control data and
data at time zero should be included in the model check.
