an S4 object of type \linkS4class{LemnaSetacScenario}
}
\description{
The model was described and published by the SETAC Europe Interest Group
Effect Modeling (Klein et al. 2022). It is based on the \emph{Lemna} model
by Schmitt (2013). The model is a mechanistic combined
toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK/TD) and growth model for the aquatic
macrophytes \emph{Lemna spp.}. The model simulates the development of Lemna biomass
under laboratory and environmental conditions. Growth of the Lemna population
is simulated on basis of photosynthesis and respiration rates which are
functions of environmental conditions. The toxicodynamic sub-model describes
the effects of growth-inhibiting substances by a respective reduction in the
photosynthesis rate based on internal concentrations.
}
\section{State variables}{

The model has two state variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{BM}, Biomass (g dw m-2)

}
}

\section{Forcings}{

Besides exposure, the model requires four environmental properties as
time-series input:
\itemize{
\item \code{tmp}, temperature (°C)
\item \code{irr}, irradiance (kJ m-2 d-1)
\item \code{P}, Phosphorus concentration (mg P L-1)
\item \code{N}, Nitrogen concentration (mg N L-1)
}

Forcings time-series are represented by \code{data.frame} objects consisting of two
columns. The first for time and the second for the environmental factor in question.

Entries of the \code{data.frame} need to be ordered chronologically. A time-series
can consist of only a single row; in this case it will represent constant
environmental conditions. See \link{scenarios} for more details.
}

\section{Effects}{

Supported effect endpoints include \emph{BM} (biomass) and \emph{r} (average
growth rate during simulation). The effect on biomass is calculated from
the last state of a simulation. Be aware that endpoint \emph{r} is incompatible
with biomass transfers.
}

\section{Simulation output}{

For reasons of convenience, the return value contains by default two additional
variables derived from simulation results: the internal concentration \code{C_int}
as well as the number of fronds \code{FrondNo}. These can be disabled by setting
the argument \code{nout = 0}.

The available output levels are as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{nout >= 1}
\itemize{
\item \code{C_int}, internal concentration (mass per volume)
}
\item \code{nout >= 2}
\itemize{
\item \code{FrondNo}, frond number (-)
}
\item \code{nout >= 4}
\itemize{
\item \code{f_loss}, respiration dependency function (-)
\item \code{f_photo}, photosynthesis dependency function (-)
}
\item \code{nout >= 10}
\itemize{

\item \code{Irr}, irradiance (kJ m-2 d-1)
\item \code{Phs}, Phosphorus concentration (mg P L-1)
\item \code{Ntr}, Nitrogen concentration (mg N L-1)
}
\item \code{nout >= 18}
\itemize{
\item \code{dBM}, biomass derivative (g dw m-2 d-1)
\item \code{dM_int}, mass of toxicant in plants derivative (mass per m2 d-1)
}
}
}

\section{Biomass transfer}{

Models supporting biomass transfer can be instructed to move a fixed amount
of biomass to a new medium after a period of time. This feature replicates
a procedure occurring in e.g. Lemna effect studies and may be necessary to
recreate study results.

The biomass transfer feature assumes that always a fixed amount of
biomass is transferred. Transfers can occur at any fixed point in time or
in regular intervals. During a transfer, the biomass is reset to the
transferred amount and additional compartments can be scaled 1:1 accordingly,
to e.g. reflect the change in internal toxicant mass when biomass is modified.
Transfer settings can be modified using \code{\link[=set_transfer]{set_transfer()}}.

Any transfer time point must also be an output time point. If a transfer
occurs, simulation results of that time point will report the model state
\strong{before} the transfer. Be aware that in order to use transfers at regular
intervals, the simulation must start at time point zero.
