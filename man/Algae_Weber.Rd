\title{Algae model with exponential growth and forcings (I, T)}
\usage{
Algae_Weber()
}
\value{
an S4 object of type \linkS4class{AlgaeWeberScenario}
}
\description{
The model is a mechanistic combined toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK/TD) and
growth model for algae. The model simulates the development of algal biomass
under laboratory and environmental conditions and was developed by
Weber et al. (2012) as cited in EFSA TKTD opinion (2018). The growth of the
algae population is simulated on the basis of growth rates, which are
dependent on environmental conditions (radiation, temperature and phosphorus).
The toxicodynamic sub-model describes the effects of growth-inhibiting
substances through a corresponding reduction in the photosynthesis rate on
the basis of internal concentrations. (the implementation of Weber et al.
(2012) is followed where units differ with EFSA)
}
\section{State variables}{

The model has four state variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{A}, Biomass (ug fresh wt/mL, cells/mL *10^4)
\item \code{Q}, Mass of phosphorous internal (mg P/L, or ug P/mL)
\item \code{P}, Mass of phosphorous external (mg P/L, or ug P/mL)
\item \code{C}, external substance concentration (ug/L)
}
}

\section{Model parameters}{

\itemize{
\item Growth model
\itemize{
\item \code{mu_max}, Maximum growth rate (d-1)
\item \code{Q_min}, Minimum intracellular P (ug P/ug fresh wt)
\item \code{Q_max}, Maximum intracellular P (ug P/ug fresh wt)
\item \code{v_max}, Maximum P-uptake rate at non-limited growth (ug P/ug fresh wt/d)
\item \code{k_s},   Half-saturation constant for extracellular P (mg P/L)
\item \code{m_max}, Natural mortality rate (1/d)
\item \code{I_opt}, Optimum light intensity for growth (uE/m²/s)
\item \code{T_opt}, Optimum temperature for growth (°C)
\item \code{T_max}, Maximum temperature for growth (°C)
\item \code{T_min}, Minimum temperature for growth (°C)
\item \code{D}, Dilution rate (1/d)
\item \code{R_0}, Influx concentration of P (mg P/L)
}
\item Concentration response (Toxicodynamics)
\itemize{
\item \code{EC_50}, Effect concentration of 50\% inhibition of growth rate (ug/L)
\item \code{b}, slope of concentration effect curve at EC_50 (-)
}
\item External concentration (Toxicokinetics)
\itemize{
\item \code{k}, Degradation rate of toxicant in aquatic environments (d-1)
}
}
}

\section{Forcings}{

Besides exposure events (C_in), the \emph{Algae} model requires three environmental
properties as time-series input: Irradiance (\code{I}, uE/m²/s)
and temperature (\code{T_act}, deg C).
Forcings time-series are represented by \code{data.frame} objects
consisting of two columns. The first for time and the second for the
environmental factor in question. The input format for all forcings is a
list of the data frames.
}

\section{Simulation output}{

Simulation results will contain the state variables Biomass (\code{A}), mass of
internal phosphorous (\code{Q}), mass of external phosphorous (\code{P}) and the external
concentration (\code{C}). The derivatives are also available as additional output.
\itemize{
\item \code{nout >= 4}
\itemize{
\item \code{dA}, biomass derivative (µg)
\item \code{dQ}, internal phosphorous derivative (mg P/ug fresh wt)
\item \code{dP}, external phosphorous derivative (mg P L-1)
\item \code{dC}, external concentration derivative (ug L-1)
}
}
}

\section{Parameter boundaries}{

Default values for parameter boundaries are set for all parameters by expert
judgement, for calibration purposes. Values can be access from the object, and
defaults overwritten.
