\title{A GUTS-RED-SD scenario of the fathead minnow}

\description{
The scenario consists of a parameterized GUTS-RED-SD model and a constant
exposure series. Model parameters were derived from an acute fish toxicity
study of the fathead minnow and chlorpyrifos by Geiger \emph{et al.} (1988).
The dataset is also referred to as \emph{GUTS Ring-test dataset C} by
EFSA (2018). Fitted parameters were estimated using the \link{morse} package.

\details{
The background mortality rate (\code{hb}) was set to zero.
