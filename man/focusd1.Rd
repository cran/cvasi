\title{A Lemna_SETAC scenario with variable environment}
\format{
An object of class \code{LemnaSetac} of length 1.
}
\usage{
focusd1
}
\description{
A mechanistic combined toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK/TD) and growth
model for the aquatic macrophytes Lemna spp. as published by
Klein \emph{et al.} (2021).
}
\details{
The scenario will simulate a period of 365 days, a start
population of 80 g/m² dry weight, variable environmental conditions, and a
complex, time-varying exposure pattern.

The scenario setup was published by Hommen \emph{et al}. (2015). Exposure pattern
and substance specific parameters are of exemplary character
and represent the herbicide \emph{metsulfuron-methyl}. The parameters were
derived by Schmitt et al. (2013) based on literature
data.
