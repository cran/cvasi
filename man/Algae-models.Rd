\section{Biomass transfer}{

Models supporting biomass transfer can be instructed to move a fixed amount
of biomass to a new medium after a period of time. This feature replicates
a procedure occurring in e.g. Lemna effect studies and may be necessary to
recreate study results.

The biomass transfer feature assumes that always a fixed amount of
biomass is transferred. Transfers can occur at any fixed point in time or
in regular intervals. During a transfer, the biomass is reset to the
transferred amount and additional compartments can be scaled 1:1 accordingly,
to e.g. reflect the change in internal toxicant mass when biomass is modified.
Transfer settings can be modified using \code{\link[=set_transfer]{set_transfer()}}.

Any transfer time point must also be an output time point. If a transfer
occurs, simulation results of that time point will report the model state
\strong{before} the transfer. Be aware that in order to use transfers at regular
intervals, the simulation must start at time point zero.
