# Simulation with the Algae_Weber model, compare against reference values
# derived from a simulation with this model for R. subcapitata and isoproturon
# (i.e., recreating the fig in EFSA Scientific Opinion on TKTD, Fig 32
# doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5377, showing the flow through exp. of Weber et
# al. 2012) This EFSA example uses the Algae_Weber model, however, to use it for
# testing the Algae_TKTD model (where there is no dilution, but there is an
# internal scaled damage), the background mortality parameter was set so it
# included both the value of background mortality and dilution from Weber's flow
# through, additionally, a high KD parameter value was taken to represent high
# uptake hence the scaled damage tracks almost instantly the water concentration
